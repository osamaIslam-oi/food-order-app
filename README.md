# Food Order App

Welcome to our Food Order App! This application allows users to browse through a variety of delicious food options and place orders seamlessly. Built with React, this app utilizes various hooks and context for state management, custom hooks for reusable logic, and sends HTTP requests to interact with a backend server for fetching data and handling orders.

## Features

- Browse through a wide range of food options.
- Add items to your cart.
- View and modify your cart contents.
- Place orders securely.
- Receive real-time updates on order status.

## Technologies Used

- React: Utilized for building the frontend interface and managing state.
- useState: Used for managing component-level state.
- useCallback: Utilized for memoizing callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- useEffect: Employed for handling side effects such as data fetching and updating.
- Custom Hooks: Created custom hooks for reusable logic and state abstraction.
- useContext: Utilized for managing global state and providing data to components.
- Sending HTTP Requests: Utilized Axios or Fetch API to communicate with the backend server.
- Error Handling: Implemented error handling for better user experience and debugging.
